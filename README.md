We are building a site where any Indian artist can put up 
his/her work and people from all over India can purchase it,

⮚ This is an initiative for the enrichment of the Indian art and 
craft, with this site we are trying to provide equal status to 
Indian art and craft as of any other western craft holds.

⮚ It will work in a very similar fashion as of any ecommerce site 
but with some extra specific features like a special section 
for Artist of the week and will run some quizzes related to 
the topic Indian culture, tradition art etc.

⮚ With this site we want to contribute to the “make in India” 
movement.
